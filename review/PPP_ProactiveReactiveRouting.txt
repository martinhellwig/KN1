1. The Content

1.a. Overall Rating:
[ ] Very Good
[x] Good
[ ] Not Good
[ ] Wrong
If wrong, please justify:

1.c. Technical Depth:
[ ] Very High, Suitable Only for an Expert#
[ ] High, Appropriate for the generally knowledgeable individual working in the field
[x] Medium, Suitable for the non-specialist#

1.d. Report Summary (indicate the main idea, contribution/solution, conclusions)(10 lines maximum, to be used by us only -not to be sent to authors-):
The summary explains proative and reactive routing protocols regarding to ad-hoc networks.
Routing protocols are needed to send messages to the right destination. In particular
the Link State Routing (OLSR) and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector Routing (DSDV)
is explained as representants for the former type and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and
Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) for the latter type of protocol.
The advantage of proactive protocols is the capability of sending packets without delay
but they introduce additional overhead. The advantage of reactive protocols is a small
overhead as long as there are no messages but routing information are only updatet
if there is any traffic.


1.e. Reviewer Confidence:
[ ] High (i.e. have read and understand most/all of the bibliography)#
