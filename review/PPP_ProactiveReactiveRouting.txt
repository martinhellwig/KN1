1. The Content

1.a. Overall Rating:
[ ] Very Good
[x] Good
[ ] Not Good
[ ] Wrong
If wrong, please justify:

1.c. Technical Depth:
[ ] Very High, Suitable Only for an Expert#
[ ] High, Appropriate for the generally knowledgeable individual working in the field
[x] Medium, Suitable for the non-specialist#
[ ] Low, Superficial#

1.d. Report Summary (indicate the main idea, contribution/solution, conclusions)(10 lines maximum, to be used by us only -not to be sent to authors-):
The summary explains proative and reactive routing protocols regarding to ad-hoc networks.
Routing protocols are needed to send messages to the right destination. In particular
the Link State Routing (OLSR) and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector Routing (DSDV)
is explained as representants for the former type and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and
Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) for the latter type of protocol.
The advantage of proactive protocols is the capability of sending packets without delay
but they introduce additional overhead. The advantage of reactive protocols is a small
overhead as long as there are no messages but routing information are only updatet
if there is any traffic.


1.e. Reviewer Confidence:
[ ] High (i.e. have read and understand most/all of the bibliography)#
[x] Medium (i.e. have partially read the bibliography, understands it partially)
[ ] Low (i.e. don't feel sure about the review made -try not to select this!-)#

3. For the Improvement

3.a. Detailed comments and suggestions for the authors to improve the report. Please number each comment (1., 2., 3. etc.). Use as many as required. If possible, indicate page, section and paragraph number. Consider restructurations, proper citation of sources, further elaboration of a particular section, typos, formatting, etc. Do *NOT* indicate what was plagiarised by the authors or where:

Introduction, page 1
	1) cf. Figure ?? for a -> which one?
	2) spelling error:	the network Hence, ...
proactive routing protocols, page 2
	3) spelling error: disadvantages of procative routing -> practive
	4) recursive process in Figure ??. -> which one?
A. Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), page 4
	5) Is the buffer full the packet waiting... -> That goes better, couldn't it? (language)
	6) DSR implements a simply -> simple
I) Path Setup:, page 4
	7) source address , -> space
	8) seq.number -> space
	9) with a more recent seq.number -> space
	10 from D,E and F -> space
2) Routing Table, page 4
	11) it saves sequence number -> numbers
	12) it saves sequence number -> inconsistent use of "seq. number" vs. "sequence number" (see previous occurences)
C. Pros and Cons of Reactive Routing, page 5

Conclusion, page 6

17) Page 1, Proactive Routing Protocols, Line 6: Missing Point between topology and It
18) Page 2: 4 column --> four columns
19) Page 3: 3) Packet Routing: "When a receiving a packet..." --> First a is too much
20) Page 3: 4) Characteristics: "DSDV is very simple..." --> DSDV is a very...
21) Page 4: 2) Route Maintenance: "... is routed back message's sender" --> ... is routed back to the sender of the message.

Logic:
22) OSLR B 1) line 5+10: "increment metric", the metric is the distance. Does it make sense to increase it each time receiving a general update?
23) In figure 3 the list is actually from node 6 not node 4 as mentioned in the caption.

Language:
24) too much "that", "is that"
25) too many commata
26) regarding nodes: maybe "it" instead of "he"

Spelling:
27) installment (Teilzahlung) -> installation
28) seq.number/seq. number
