1.d. Report Summary (indicate the main idea, contribution/solution, conclusions)(10 lines maximum, to be used by us only -not to be sent to authors-):
They want to show how to deal with errors in communication. For this approach they presented a few possobilities to achhieve an error-free communication. As the last and best solution they show the Sliding-Windows-approach. For this purpose they used many pictures to visualize the proceed of the protocol. Short textes explain the pictures and the use of lower and upper bounds.

1) Motivation, Line 4: "sought" should be "seen"
2) Introduction, Page 2, Line 7: "the" can be discarded
3) Introduction, Page 2, Line 14: "acknowledgement" should be plural
4) Introduction, Page 2, Line 21: Double "in"
5 Control Protocols, Page 2, Figure 2: DSAP, never explained
6) Page 2: Control Protocols hat also Number 2, like Introduction
Stop-and-wait/PAR, Page 3, PAR: explained afterwards/not directly
Stop-and-wait/PAR, Page 3, ... Which is based.. -> Was this a whole sentence?
Stop-and-wait/PAR, Page 3, ARQ(Automatic -> missing space
Stop-and-wait/PAR, Page 3, as if itâ€™s too short than -> "then"
Stop-and-Wait / PAR / SeqNo., Page 3, sequence no(Fig 5). -> missing space, "sequence no."
Stop-and-Wait / PAR / SeqNo., Page 3, Syntax: fig.5 -> Fig. 5
Stop-and-Wait / NAC+ACK / SeqNo, Page 3, Stop-and-Wait / NAC+ACK / SeqNo -> NAC? shoud be NAK OR NACK (see figure 6)
Stop-and-Wait / NAC+ACK / SeqNo, Page 3, they assume they everything -> they assume that?
Stop-and-Wait / NAC+ACK / SeqNo, Page 3, was sent was sent -> one time should be enough, don't you think?
Stop-and-Wait / NAC+ACK / SeqNo, Page 3, In this case, Stop-and-Wait / NAC+ACK / SeqNo, fig.... -> NAC? or NAK?? (see figure 6)
Stop-and-Wait / NAC+ACK / SeqNo, Page 3, In this case, Stop-and-Wait / NAC+ACK / SeqNo, fig.... -> is the figure part of the sentence?
6) Control Protocols, Page 3, Line 8: "isan" to "is an"
7) Control Protocols, Page 3, Line 17: "terminal" to "time"
8) Control Protocols, Page 3, Line 21: the whole sentence is a bit confusing and grammatically not correct

Sliding Window, Page 4, which implies and both, sender -> implies what?
Sliding Window, Page 4, Protocol works by... -> The protocol...
Sliding Window, Page 4, When to increment lower and -> When the lower and upper bound has to be incremented..?

10) Control Protocols, Page 4, Line 4: "a" is too much
Sliding Window, Page 5, At the sender stored frames -> At the sender side...?
Sliding Window: Go-back-N(Error Treatment), Page 5, ...is found faulty then protocol all the other -> sorry but I can't make a Reim on that
Sliding Window: Go-back-N(Error Treatment), Page 5, ...is found faulty then protocol all the other -> sorry but I can't make a Reim on that
Sliding Window: Go-back-N(Error Treatment), Page 5, ...protocol until-unless -> until or unless? please decide
Sliding Window: Go-back-N(Error Treatment), Page 5, Optimization for this approach is to have -> One Optimization for..
11) Control Protocols, Page 5, Line 1: "the" is too much
